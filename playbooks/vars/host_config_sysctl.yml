# Ensure your system has sufficient memory to handle the increased limits,

# The default limits here are exceeded very readily under even modest load.

    comment: Maximum number of connection requests that can be queued to a given listening socket. Needs to absorb burst of connection requests. AIS clients will usually keep connections open to proxy and targets, so we do not expect ongoing high new connection rate.

    comment: If sockets hang around in timewait state for long then (since we're PUTting and GETting lots of objects) we very soon find that we exhaust local port range. So we stretch the available range of local ports (ip_local_port_range), increase the max number of timewait buckets held by the system simultaneously (tcp_max_tw_buckets), and reuse sockets in timewait state as soon as it is "safe from a protocol point of view" (whatever that means, tcp_tw_reuse).

    comment: Maximal number of timewait sockets held by system simultaneously. If this number is exceeded time-wait socket is immediately destroyed and warning is printed. This limit exists only to prevent simple DoS attacks, you must not lower the limit artificially, but rather increase it (probably, after increasing installed memory), if network conditions require more than default value. See comment for tw_reuse.

# If you have fast networking you're going to have to tune these for good results, but we can't
# anticipate all environments so these are not applied unless requested. If you already have
# your own tuning stick with that for starters; if you have little tuning an big network
# pipes then use this as a starting point. These values worked well on hosts with 50 and
# 100 GigE Mellanox CX-5 cards.

    comment: Max receive socket buffer size for all protocols. AIS uses TCP, so net.ipv4.tcp_rmem over-rides there. Tweak to allow apps using SO_RCVBUF wide range. Will not apply to AIS, but does apply to the UDP buffers used by statsd.
