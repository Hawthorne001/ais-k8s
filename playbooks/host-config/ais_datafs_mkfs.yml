#
# Perform mkfs of AIS target filesystems. Not something you want to do lightly, so intentionally
# a little awkward to run - we don't include default values for ais_hosts and ais_devices,
# requiring that they be passed on the cmdline (defaulting to k8s-cluster, for example,
# could be bad!)
#
# After mkfs we will add the filesystems to /etc/fstab and mount them.
#
# This playbook will prompt for confirmation when the play is run interactively.
#
# Example usage:
#
#       ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ais_datafs_mkfs.yml \
#               -e '{"ais_hosts": ["cpu01", "cpu02"], \
#               "ais_devices": ["sda", "sdb", "sdc", "sdd", "sde", "sdf", "sdg", "sdh", "sdi", "sdj"]}' \
#               --become
#
# In initial establishment of a set of hosts you might use an inventory group to target hosts,
# such as ... -e '{"ais_hosts": ["cpu-worker-node"] ...
#
# You can list ais_devices in vars/ais_datafs.yml, but shouldn't list ais_hosts there.
